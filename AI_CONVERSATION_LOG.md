# AI Conversation Log - Campus Event Management Platform

## Date: September 6, 2025

### Initial Brainstorming Session

**AI Tool Used:** GitHub Copilot

### Problem Analysis

- **Scenario:** Building a Campus Event Management Platform
- **Components:** Admin Portal (Web) + Student App (Mobile)
- **Core Features:** Event creation, student registration, attendance tracking, reporting

### AI Suggestions Followed:

1. **Tech Stack Selection:**

   - Backend: Node.js with Express (chosen for rapid development)
   - Database: SQLite for prototype (easily scalable to PostgreSQL)
   - API: RESTful architecture
   - Frontend: React for admin portal

2. **Database Design:**
   - Normalized schema with separate tables for colleges, events, students, registrations
   - AI suggested using UUID for cross-college uniqueness
   - Implemented composite keys for better performance

### AI Suggestions Modified:

1. **Scale Considerations:**

   - AI initially suggested single large dataset
   - Modified to use college-specific partitioning for better performance
   - Added college_id prefix to event IDs for uniqueness

2. **API Design:**
   - AI suggested basic CRUD operations
   - Enhanced with specific reporting endpoints
   - Added bulk operations for better performance

### Key Decisions Made:

- Event IDs will be unique across colleges using format: `{college_id}-{event_id}`
- Multi-tenant architecture with college-based data separation
- Comprehensive reporting system with flexible filtering
- Mobile-first API design for student app compatibility

### Implementation Approach:

1. Design comprehensive database schema
2. Create RESTful API endpoints
3. Implement reporting queries
4. Build basic admin portal
5. Create sample data and test scenarios
